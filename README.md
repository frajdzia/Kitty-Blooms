## NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025

**BloomWatch**: An Earth Observation Application for Global Flowering Phenology

### About

Its a web app visualizing Poland’s blooming areas using NASA’s MODIS NDVI data from the ORNL DAAC API. It displays blooming hotspots _(NDVI > 0.3)_ on a map, with a slider to switch months and an ML-powered popup predicting October blooms. It helps Polish farmers time planting seasons for better crop yields and supports pollinator conservation by identifying bloom hotspots.
The project’s creative integration of real-time NASA data and machine learning offers a scalable, user-friendly tool for environmental monitoring. Kitty Blooms addresses the challenge of unpredictable bloom patterns due to climate change, fostering sustainable agriculture and biodiversity.
